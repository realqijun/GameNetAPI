    FIN_WAIT2 happens after FIN_WAIT1 and the socket is waiting for remote to send FIN.

    In this state, there are several special cases to consider:

    - SYN ACK: sends the appropriate ACK back to remote. This happens when previous ACKs are lost.
    - FIN: sends the appropriate ACK back to remote and transition into TIME_WAIT.
    - RST: terminates the connection immediately.
    - Pure ACK: updates largest received ACK.
    - Data packets: processes each on in-order and update REC and ACK accordingly. If the socket
      is stuck on an ACK for too long, it will automatically go to the nearest next SEQ that it has received.

    All other packets are dropped and ignored.
